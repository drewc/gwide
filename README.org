#+TITLE:GWIDE : Gerbil Web IDE

I'm a veteran web developer and gerbil user. The twain shall meet!

* The Gerbil Subtree

For various reasons we currently have a gerbil subtree. Essentially I
figured I'll need a branch and this is a good place to store it.

#+begin_src sh
  git subtree add --prefix gerbil \
      git@github.com:mighty-gerbils/gerbil.git master --squash
#+end_src
